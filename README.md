Decision-Trees, Random-Forests, and Neural-Networks are implemented from scratch using python.

A Decision Tree is constructed using the data obtained from the VirusShare dataset such that at each attribute there is maximum decrease in the entropy of the class variable. 
The accuracies have been plotted against the size of the tree for proper anaylsis.

Random forest is implemented here using the Scikit-learn library and different forests were grown according to the different model hyper-parameters and a grid-search was
performed in order to get the best set of parameters. Proper parameter sensitivity analysis was also carried out.
